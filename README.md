## Shared Components

Just a repo for shared components for my projects.

Run `npm run build` before pushing updates to this project.

Add `"@eldritchtools/shared-components": "github:eldritchtools/shared-components"` to `dependencies` in `package.json` and run `npm install` to import this into other projects.
